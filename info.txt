Information for blackjack

The Pack
The standard 52 pack is used with six decks (312 cards)
There is a blank plastic card, which is never dealt - usually
to indicate when it will be time for the cards to be reshuffled

Object of The Game
Each participant attempts to beat the dealer by getting a count
as close to 21 as possible without going over 21

Card Values/Scoring
It is up to each individual player if an ace is worth 1 or 11
Face cards are 10 and any other card is its pip value

Betting
Before the deal begins, each player places a bet
Minimum - $ 2
Maximum - $ 500

The Shuffle and Cut
Dealer shuffles portions of the pack until all the cards have
been mixed and combines
Designates that the last 60 to 75 cards will not be used

The Deal
When all players placed their bets - dealer gives one card
face up to each player and one card face up to himself.

Naturals
Ace + ten card = blackjack - the dealer immediately pays
the player one and a half times the amount of his bet
OR the dealer collects the bets of all players who do not have
naturals

If the dealer and another player both have naturals, the bet
is a standoff and player takes back his chips

The Play
The Player goes first and must decide whether to "stand" (not ask
for another card) or hit.
